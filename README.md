Overview
This project focuses on analyzing aviation incident data to uncover trends, risks, and insights that can enhance aviation safety. The data encompasses details about accident severity, locations, weather conditions, and flight purposes, allowing us to address key business questions and provide actionable recommendations.
Business Understanding
Stakeholders
Aviation Regulators: Organizations like the FAA and ICAO interested in improving safety protocols.
Airlines and Operators: Concerned with reducing operational risks and improving training programs.
Airport Authorities: Focused on managing infrastructure and emergency preparedness.
Pilots and Crew Members: Require insights into high-risk scenarios to improve decision-making.
Passengers: Indirect stakeholders benefiting from improved aviation safety. 
Key Business Questions
What are the trends in aviation incidents over time, and how do they vary by country or region?
Which types of flights are more prone to incidents, and why?
How do weather conditions influence the occurrence and severity of aviation incidents?
What recommendations can improve safety for high-risk scenarios?
Data Understanding and Analysis
Source of Data
The data was sourced from aviation incident reports maintained by global aviation safety authorities. The dataset contains 2961 records and 5 fields, including details on:

Incident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Minor, Uninjured)
Geographical Location (Latitude, Longitude, Country)
Flight Purpose (Personal, Commercial, Training, etc.)
Weather Conditions (Clear, Adverse)
Description of Data
The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Key attributes include:
Event.Date: Date of the incident.
Country: Country where the incident occurred.
Injury.Severity: Categorized into total fatalities, serious injuries, and minor injuries.
Purpose.of.Flight: Type of flight operation, such as commercial or personal.
Weather.Condition: Categorized into clear or adverse conditions.

Conclusions 
The average fatalities are affected by weather condition. Most of the accidents have turned out fatal with a high percentage of total fatal injuries. 
The make and model of the plane have a lower impact on the number of fatalities. 
Aviation incidents and injuries exhibit identifiable trends over time, with some years having a significant spike in incidents. These trends may align with factors like increased air traffic, regulatory changes, or geopolitical events.
